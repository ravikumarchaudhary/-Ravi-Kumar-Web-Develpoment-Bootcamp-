//Authentication and security in websites

Authentication and authorization both play important roles in online security systems. They confirm the identity of the user and grant access to your website or application. 
It’s vital that you make note of their differences so you can determine which combination of web tools best suit your security needs.
Security authentication and authorization should be incorporated into any website, especially those that deal with online transactions or personal information. Since anyone
with the “key” can gain access, it’s vital that companies implement a strong authentication system to keep unauthorized users from accessing accounts without permission.
